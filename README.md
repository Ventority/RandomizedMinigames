<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

I got inspired by a streamer and youtuber who plays these kinds of Minigames (BastiGHG). The plugin aims to bring many of these games to his audience and maybe some other people who are interested. There are multiple in-game GUIs that are used for various actions including each part of the setup.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

`/minigames` - Opens a GUI of all available Minigames.<br>
`/minigames killall`- Kills all minigames currently running, will be removed in the future since it shouldn't be necessary<br>
